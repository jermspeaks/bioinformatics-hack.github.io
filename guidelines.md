Bioinformatics Hack is intended for public participatory projects related to space exploration.
By using Bioinformatics Hack, you are subject to these Community Guidelines.

We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Please play nice with our wonderful community of bioinformatics hackers and don’t be a troll.

Don’t submit projects that the public can’t participate in. While it may be really awesome, it doesn’t fit the purpose of this site. Also, projects listed here must be open to the public right now, if public participation is coming soon, send us a submission when it goes live.

Don’t lie. We do our best to verify that the information you submitted about the project and your relation to it is correct, but we will be less than happy with you if you knowingly submit information that is false or misleading.

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify the Community Guidelines at any time.
